*  Over 70% of the H-1B workforce is Indian.  The increased costs are prompting many to explore alternative visa options or direct green card routes. [https://www.news18.com/explainers/explained-how-h-1b-l-1-visas-work-how-to-get-a-green-card-and-the-path-to-us-citizenship-ws-l-9593630.html]


## Contradictions

A significant contradiction exists regarding the implementation date of the $100,000 fee.  While some sources state the fee applies to petitions submitted *after* September 21, 2025 [https://www.news18.com/explainers/explained-how-h-1b-l-1-visas-work-how-to-get-a-green-card-and-the-path-to-us-citizenship-ws-l-9593630.html], other sources lack this specific date [https://indianexpress.com/article/world/h1b-visa-2025-fees-validity-period-new-rules-latest-policy-and-changes-you-must-know-10268564/].  Further investigation is needed to clarify this discrepancy.  Additional inconsistencies exist in the reporting of various numerical data points across sources.  This includes discrepancies in the year mentioned (2025 vs. other years) and the number of changes mentioned.  These inconsistencies are detailed in the provided contradiction data.


## Conclusion

The H-1B visa program has undergone substantial changes, significantly impacting international workers.  However, inconsistencies in reporting require further investigation to ensure accuracy and clarity.
